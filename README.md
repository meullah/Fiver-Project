# Angular Interview

## Pros and Cons of a few methods of communication between Angular components.

Methods for comuncations are:

1. Parent to Child Communication
    - Using @Input Decorator to Pass Data
    - Listen for Input Changes
    - OnChanges Life Cycle hook
    - Angular @input, @output & EventEmitter

2. Child to Parent Communication
    - Listens to Events from Child (Output & EventEmitter)
    - Uses Local Variable to access the child in the Template
    - Uses a @ViewChild to get a reference to the child component

3. Interaction when there is no parent-child relation
    - Services can be used in such cases.

Usage depend upon the requirements. Evey method has its own advantage or usage. Can not tell pros and cons 


## Describe 3 things you dislike about Angular?

I am not familiar with any major disadvantage of Angular. Some people say it is slow. 
Project size is big as compared to others. But I don't feel any of these.
